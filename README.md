Absolutely! If you want to post your calculator code on *GitHub, it's a good idea to include a **README file* that explains the theory behind the code. This helps others understand what your code does, how it works, and how to use it.

Here‚Äôs a *README.md theory section* you can copy and include in your GitHub project:

## üìñ Theory - Simple Python Calculator

This project is a *console-based calculator* written in *Python* that performs basic arithmetic operations:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

### üîß Program Structure

The calculator is built using *functions, a **menu-driven loop, and **user input handling*.

---

### ‚úÖ Function Definitions

The program defines four functions:

python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y


* Adds two numbers and returns the result.

python
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y


* Subtracts the second number from the first.

python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y


* Multiplies two numbers.

python
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    return x / y


* Divides the first number by the second.
* Handles the special case of division by zero.

### üîÅ Loop and Menu

The main part of the program runs inside a while True loop that:

1. Displays a menu of operations.
2. Takes the user's choice.
3. Asks for two numbers.
4. Performs the selected operation.
5. Repeats until the user selects "Exit".

Example menu:


Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit

### üõ° Input Validation

The program includes basic error handling:

* Uses try-except to check if user input is a valid number.
* Checks for division by zero in the divide() function.
* Prints an error message for invalid menu choices.

---

### üß† Key Concepts Used

* *Functions*: To modularize code for reuse and clarity.
* *Loops*: To keep the program running until the user exits.
* *Conditionals*: To execute different code blocks based on user input.
* *Exception Handling*: To manage unexpected or invalid input without crashing.

### üí° Example


Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
